7/10, drone flew. great in those terms, we have encoder tracking, still working on back projection :splitter: Mon Jul 29 20:58:25 2024
7/10, we got a lot of work done, I am working on fixing the time error :splitter: Fri Jul 26 20:58:27 2024
7/10, good day but the drone base was replaced and it still dosent fly correctly, it tips the wrong way. :splitter: Thu Jul 25 20:54:57 2024
6/10 day, were hoping to get the drone in the air, yet the issues still persist :splitter: Wed Jul 24 20:54:57 2024
7/10, good day, we did overall go to fix our motors, which just needed leveling :splitter: Tue Jul 23 21:02:26 2024
7/10, good day, data collected, BP works, RTI new with data/ drone moving works, drone testing done, one motor is flipped, day went well, will get it done soon, and lastly the FBP is on its way as the image is very arbitary currently. :splitter: Mon Jul 22 20:55:09 2024
Solid 7/10, we got back projection working, and we also worked on frequency projection as we were using back projection with time, but max found a way to use it with frequency. A highly complicated topic, but thats somethihng to figure out later at home, there are calculs integrals i have to learn about to figure it out, but I realized today that .ravel is a really helpful thing in niche cases. :splitter: Thu Jul 18 20:57:11 2024

It was a 7/10, audrupilot is getting setup but our joysticks and controlls are not in sync to what they should be assigned to, so me and owen tried to fic them, and it has been fixed :splitter: Tue Jul 16 20:54:23 2024
It was a 7/10, still trying to comprehend back projection, but am understanding the concept involving a modifyable empty array and understanding the back projection integral. :splitter: Mon Jul 15 20:54:52 2024
it went good 7/10 :splitter: Fri Jul 12 20:51:21 2024
it was a good day today,  8/10, we have the receiving code being decoded, and we are able to make the plot, but just trying to use the spectogram to be more precise in its high sample rates :splitter: Thu Jul 11 20:47:10 2024
It was a good day today, 8/10, we have some issues in code to clear :splitter: Wed Jul 10 20:55:47 2024
