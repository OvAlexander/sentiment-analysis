Sure, but I'm pretty sure it would be hard to integrate these reviews into the main graph. :splitter: Wed Jul 31 01:02:05 2024

We had to switch the entire bottom of the drone’s airframe today. Yay. Fun. There was apparently a failure (short circuit or something) in one of the motor controllers, which made it shake the motor instead of spin it. Unfortunately, we wanted a UAV, not a UGV, which meant we had to take out everything connected to that motor controller. Which included the literal bottom half of the aircraft.
It wasn’t all bad today, though. The motion detection code started working so, we have one less thing to worry about. :splitter: Mon Jul 22 13:06:20 2024
The motion detection code for the radar failed. It didn’t even fail spectacularly. How sad.
Instead of detecting the motion of a clearly visible corner reflector, the code decided that both stationary and moving objects were perfectly similar and that there was nothing strange about the huge blip on the RTI plot heading toward it. Unfortunately, that resulted in thirty minutes of testing getting wasted. Fortunately, Yuno made the time more productive with his C++ coding.
Our drone did work quite well, though. Hopefully tomorrow we can get it rewired completely.

Wednesday: The backprojection arms race is going, and becoming quite hilarious. On team 3's side there's a team of good, competent and motivated coders. On ours, we have a mad genius, about to use the dark arts of cython to convert a regular python backprojection code to a 2000 line eldritch abomination in C. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen!
Seriously though, we made a bunch of progress in motion capture, radar, and drone building. Today was a good day. :splitter: Mon Jul 22 12:36:22 2024
Today was alright - there was a lot of fiddling with both backprojection and RTI plots, but eventually both worked alright. Back projection in particular generated a lot of strange artifacts and plots before actually working. Besides that, the drone's connection required a downloaded driver communication software. For some reason, this was not available in several computer downloads that should have given it. 
Overall it was good. :splitter: Thu Jul 18 02:02:39 2024
Today was annoying. This was primarily due to the fact that Pycharm simply refused to work with matplotlib, despite the obvious (and many unobvious problems) being solved. Eventually, I fixed the problem, though not before scourring the internet for multiple hours. It apparently was a problem with the C++ behind the python.
The drone flying was pretty cool though. :splitter: Tue Jul 16 02:57:14 2024
The RTI plot that we have is crude, and models waveforms and the signal that was sent out as well as the signals we actually want, but it actually works.  I'll have to add more modification to the graph and clean it up a bit. I have zero idea on code based device communication, especially with a microprocessor, so I should probably stay out of the way of my teammates. Hopefully Monday will be the end of all of the RTI plot struggles. Also, yes, I will remember to write more comments. :splitter: Sun Jul 14 23:42:22 2024
Despite the really annoying reality of coding in realtime - the merges and conflicts and other github problems you have to solve - this was a very fun session. The RTI plot isn't fully finished, but we'll probably get to that later. Besides that though, the raspberry pi development was very rewarding. I think we're 70% the way to a working plot. :splitter: Sun Jul 14 23:36:01 2024
Today's drone building was nice - we made a lot of progress in not a lot of time. The API and raspberry pi programming were complicated, though the most annoying part was setting up the autopilot. Overall the day was rewarding, though. :splitter: Thu Jul 11 12:34:43 2024
8/10 - Drone building was fun, and despite the scavenger hunt being extremely unrewarding, the day was good. :splitter: Tue Jul  9 21:00:31 2024
8/10 - Not a bad introduction, though there probably could have been better guidance between buildings. It was a good lesson altogether. :splitter: Tue Jul  9 00:52:59 2024
