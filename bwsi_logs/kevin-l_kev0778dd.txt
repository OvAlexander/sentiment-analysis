today we were able to improve out backprojection algorithm by adding interactive features to it. 8.9/10 :splitter: Tue Jul 30 20:41:53 2024
I was able to run the radar data recording on my laptop as a backup for the team and our real data backprojection plot is getting better. :splitter: Thu Jul 25 21:16:10 2024
My team figured out a crucial detail that we were neglecting which is the potential of getting duplicates from the radar scan. :splitter: Wed Jul 24 21:11:42 2024

Today I had the whole morning getting introduced to the BWSI course and its expectations and some activities. After having lunch with people I am completely not familiar with, I was  taken to the SAR course room. We spent around two hours introducing each of us and had some fun icebreaker games. Finally, we were tasked with a "song list" activity that is kind of github-operation related, which caused  some confusion to my group but we eventually figured it out. I would rate today's experience an 8 out of 10. :splitter: Mon Jul  8 23:00:53 2024
