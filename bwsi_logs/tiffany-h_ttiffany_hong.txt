8.8/10 Made necessary changes to GUI code, rehearsed for final presentation, and GPR code :splitter: Fri Aug  2 03:46:11 2024
8.7/10

            I got to have a final/completed version of GUI code after numerous trial and error. It was really frustrating trying to connect all of the necessary code files together; there could’ve been an efficient way, but I had close to no experience making GUIs. There were still meaningful insights. Afterwards, I spent some time with Jackie finishing the presentation for tomorrow. :splitter: Wed Jul 31 23:33:13 2024
8.95/10

    My group and I were able to collect several pieces of data at HIgh Bay today; while others were working on the algorithm for back projection/RTI, I continued working and researching about the GUI for extra points. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the ModuleNotFound error, but it eventually worked out. I just need to make it so that the GUI outputs appropriate data. This can be used for bots. :splitter: Tue Jul 30 22:50:57 2024
9/10

    My group and I spent quite a lot of time in High Bay collecting data. Afterwards, I reformatted the back projection code using name-equals-main construct and combined it with pickle-to-dictionary converter code. I spent the rest of my time converting .npy file to .csv for GPR challenge and researched/coded GUI for convenience. :splitter: Mon Jul 29 23:29:21 2024
8.7/10 (7/25)

Went to High Bay for a flight test; it didn’t work out well. I spent most of my time adding images for both video and final-presentation slides, starting with code for making dictionary files (pickle_maker.py), and started to research more about the GPR, and convert the given .npy file.


8.8/10

The drone worked on its very last flight at the High Bay. The tour at the laboratory was very interesting; I learned some valuable insights. I spent the rest of my time finishing the pickle_maker.py code, reformatting Akshay’s back projection code (adding name == main), and reformatting the slides a bit. :splitter: Sat Jul 27 00:46:25 2024
8.3/10 I continued collecting previous images/data for final presentation, and spent quite of time on the High Bay for mocap data collection. The seminar and additional lesson/presentation about radar data collection under ground were my personal-best presentations throught the BWSI program. I really appreciate the insights that the mentors/instructors were able to give to other peers and I. :splitter: Wed Jul 24 21:02:14 2024
8.2/10 

Finished working on the motion capture data reader, went to drone testing several times, started and finished making a basic template for the final presentation slides :splitter: Tue Jul 23 22:29:46 2024
8.2/10

I worked on converting the motion capture almost throughput the whole day. It took longer time than it was expected; due to miscommunication, I formatted the code to complete the different task that what the teammates have asked to (I also didn’t know that I was supposed to use pandas). Everything eventually worked out, and I got to finish around 97.75% of the code in the end. Akshay told me that he would work on removing NaN in the data array. :splitter: Mon Jul 22 21:05:50 2024
8.7/10

I was able to finish the final version of pickle code converter, csv file converter, and am close to finishing the back projected imagery code. All I need to do is call the unpickled file into the back projection code and test the prototype; our group also decided to put more effort into the coding during the weekends since we are starting to get behind. But everything is planned out. :splitter: Fri Jul 19 22:28:18 2024
8.6/10

Me and Jackie made changes to the pickle file converter code so it could read the truncated part of the scan data. For the back projection code, I got to put random magnitude/variables to see how that directly or indirectly affects the image. Afterwards, I spent the rest of my time researching and making adjustments to the back projection code and csv code based on the feedback that the TAs gave our group. :splitter: Fri Jul 19 02:57:07 2024
8.5/10

I made simple changes to the csv file converter for better format. Afterwards, Jackie and I got to rework on the back projection code due to misunderstandings of the direction and concept. We were able to have a better idea of the structure of the code after doing additional research and listening to the review lecture. We also spent some time trying to understand where each sample data is used for the code, and converted those appropriately (e.g. scan data to magnitude). :splitter: Thu Jul 18 01:32:30 2024
My apologies, I got to write my journals entries on google docs, but then forgot to put it back on the discord again. I’ll remind myself better next time. Here are the entries from past three days:

8.2 (7/12)
Jackie and I worked on the weekly report slide. There were some flaws that I noticed later on; I should put in more details. I researched about finding slow-time data for RTI plot, and continued coding/researching all around the place; my schedule was a bit unorganized.


8.5/10 (7/15)
I have both started and finished writing the draft code for the csv file converter. Afterwards, I started to research more in depth about concepts and equations of the back projection image. There wasn’t any major parts that I could help with the RTI plotting code since Joshua, Akshay, and Matthew were each working on all the different parts of the code related to that; I helped with researching though.


8.6(7/16)
I got to write a simple pickle file converter, finish the final code for csv file converter, and continue researching about the sar back projection method. Most of the research was focused on the algorithm/equation. Later on the day, I was able to write the equation parts (reconstructed signal intensity) of the back-projection code. I needed to research a lot since there were parts of the equation that I possibly couldn’t understand since I haven’t taken calculus AB yet. :splitter: Wed Jul 17 00:05:41 2024
8.3/10

My teammates and I made more progress in coding compared to yesterday. The pieces are starting to come together. I got to understand several concepts that used to be frustrating as well. I’m hoping/planning to participate more on the coding aspects than researching concepts; the insights from research were useful, and I did code as well, but I want to have experiences in different fields as well. :splitter: Thu Jul 11 23:08:34 2024
I'm going to arrive around 9:05. I left my home  around 8:30 since ot takes 40 to 50 minutes to get to MIT, but the traffics are way much heavier than expected. :splitter: Thu Jul 11 12:52:35 2024
8.1/10

Quite a bit of the new concepts were easy to understand, but the information was starting to get confusing as we started researching by ourselves. It was challenging to think of a code based on the new information given, but our team and I were eventually able to complete most of the parts. It was a nice experience, both to learn and review about impulse radar. :splitter: Thu Jul 11 00:52:58 2024
8.8/10

Today went smoother compared to yesterday. The concepts weren’t challenging to understand since most of the slides were for reviews; I only needed to add on a few more bullet points from previous notes. Scavenger hunt was a bit exhausting, but it gave me a nice opportunity for a walk around the campus. :splitter: Tue Jul  9 21:29:24 2024
8.2/10

The technology issues with wifi and Discord made me a bit embarrassed/frustrated, but everything went smoothly afterwards. I’m glad that I got to know some of my peers already, and I can’t wait for the actual lecture to begin tomorrow! :splitter: Tue Jul  8 00:51:56 2024
