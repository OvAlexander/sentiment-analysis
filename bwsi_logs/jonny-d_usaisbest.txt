8/10 the drone works(fingers crossed) so life is good :splitter: Thu Aug  1 21:43:14 2024
Woops forgot this yesterday, but it was like 8/10 :splitter: Thu Aug  1 12:05:17 2024
8/10 the drone is a pain. But the radar is working now and we are working on MOCAP and back projection. We still can implement the non hard coded method in the rpi code, but that is not a need to do thing. it is important, but not essential.

Yall can plot my numbers, I do consent. :splitter: Tue Jul 30 21:01:46 2024
Thanks :splitter: Mon Jul 29 23:58:08 2024
FYI, I have sent an email to BWSI admin to appeal :splitter: Mon Jul 29 23:20:59 2024
6/10, everything is broken now, the drone does not fly, and (weather true or not) I have another strike for phone use in the lecture. Also I am emailing the admin to try to appeal. Since I was sitting on the isle, the recording of the seminar should show clearly if I was on my phone at any point. :splitter: Mon Jul 29 21:03:21 2024
Sorry, I was in line for the restroom :splitter: Mon Jul 29 17:33:45 2024
10/10, tour was cool, things are going slow but making progress. The problem now is the drone... Our luck ran out :splitter: Fri Jul 26 20:56:23 2024
Tasks:
Automate finding when the radar starts moving.
Pack date in pickle better.

8/10
We tried to fly the first time and code that I wrote did not run. Because the code on the pi was not turned on. Because the battery was removed which ended the code, then when the new battery was attached the code was not restarted. Meta-level, it was not a fault of my code. No one knew this at the moment but people did lay into me slightly. We figured it out and people now take flying more seriously, which are both good. But I was a little hurt by the back handed attacks. it is ok but like, whatever. 7/10 :splitter: Thu Jul 25 21:00:30 2024
7/10, kinda feel stuck. :splitter: Wed Jul 24 20:57:28 2024
9/10 We cant do much without live data, so we need that :splitter: Tue Jul 23 20:59:25 2024
9/10 I incrementally improved the rti plotter and made a delta plotter. I also made it so they can run simultaneously on the same data with two different sockets, both live. Probably took it a little far. I also restored the ability to make a still frame from a csv file of data. Just small stuff but it adds up.

Back projection is going well from what I hear, I am not on that team so I don't know the details, but I have seen the results. Victoria is still struggling with the MoCap data and Sarah has completed the method to replace the hard-coding, and is now working on implementing the method into the main code. 

There are three things I can do tomorrow: figure out changing the max range that the radar looks out to, try helping Victoria with the MoCap, or try helping Sarah with the hard-coding replacement. I think the team would be best served if I tried helping Victoria. The rti plots work, but could be better. Sarah appears not to want help with the implementation and is making progress anyway. In contrast, we have no working MoCap data thing, and we have to figure that out. Basically, the priority of work is to work on MoCap fir and foremost, but if we figure that out fast or I am being a drag on Victoria then I will try the other two options. MoCap is by far the most important for me to work on. :splitter: Mon Jul 22 20:44:49 2024
10/10 got auto sending data with no file transfers. Next I am going to make the RTI plot scroll! :splitter: Thu Jul 18 20:51:07 2024
7/10 at lunch everything worked well. But pushing to gihub broke everything, it is now back to the functionality of like yesterday noon :splitter: Wed Jul 17 21:26:36 2024
10/10 While we still have a lot to do to improve the RTI plot, but on the most basic level, it works. Also, our drone it fully assembled and the rotors are spinning the right way. We need to fly tomorrow and work on fixing the RTI, but right now we are making a bushel load of progress. :splitter: Tue Jul 16 20:54:07 2024
Go for it! :splitter: Mon Jul 15 23:32:59 2024
8/10, everything is broken, but in a better way than last week. The code is kinda working, the annoying thing is the drone is broken and it looks like it's not our fault :splitter: Mon Jul 15 21:01:31 2024
9/10 we might be a little behind, but that's ok. The puzzle pieces are fully visiblee, we just have to fit them together :splitter: Fri Jul 12 20:57:15 2024
8/10 hard stuff, still blind. But I am kinda starting to understand what is happening, kinda. Your speeches were both very good, thank you. :splitter: Thu Jul 11 20:56:35 2024
Awesome, thanks :splitter: Thu Jul 11 17:30:13 2024
Ignore 2nd point, I have been converted to struct :splitter: Thu Jul 11 17:17:15 2024
How should I handle these issues? :splitter: Thu Jul 11 17:03:53 2024
One other concern I have is that Jeffrey is very concerned that we are way behind other teams. He suggested that we all dev even after class today after yall explicitly said not to. :splitter: Thu Jul 11 17:03:32 2024
We have a small but growing problem. We have a working way of setting up the radar and receiving data. Jeffrey has a non working code that does the same thing but "is more robust and better." He wants both of us to work on getting his code to work because, "it will work better in the future." It may very well be a better method, but I don't understand his code and I don't see how it is better than what we have. I am fine with him working on his program, but I don't want to try to work on a code that has the same functionality as what we already have for some unknown benefits in the future. My view is that if the current method breaks we can use how it breaks to inform making the "better" method solve the new problem. I am fine with him working on it if he wants to, but I don't want to be forced to work on it myself.

On a related issue, we are at the point where we are getting the data packet from the radar, and now we need to decode the data from the packet. He wants him and I to both make one method that makes uses struct to extract the data. I have a partly working program that treats the packet as a string and manipulates it to get the data out. I have no doubt that using struct is more efficient and faster. However, I don't know if we need that speed and efficiency. Additionally, we already have a partly working program that I can finish quickly and then test to find if it needs to be faster. Again it is a case of potentially a better method and a method that works right know. I am fine fixing thing if/when they break. I don't want to not finish the project because we got lost using the best methods. I believe that getting a low quality output is better than no output. And again, I don't want to be forced to work on a project I don't have confidence in. He can do it if he wants, but I don't like him trying to force me to do it. :splitter: Thu Jul 11 17:03:25 2024
4/10 I feel that it was a mistrurth to say the online python class was all required to complete this class. Not only are we doing completely different things atm, we are having to use a Linux command line which was not covered at all in the course.

Additionally, it appears the survey we completed to "allow your instructor to make balanced teams" was not used at all. There is a team with 3 softwares guys while other teams are all people who have nothing besides the prerec. The teams are just unbalanced.

It's like I am making progress by blind luck and barely learning anything. I know I would learn more if I was given a foundation for the information I am finding. From all the programming I have done in the past, I have effectivly no foundation for this new stuff. :splitter: Wed Jul 10 23:27:22 2024
that is the screen shot you asked for :splitter: Wed Jul 10 22:20:17 2024

I am the youngest 6 so if you even call me something even close to my name I will respond. I do spell it Jonny though, but only because I am a linguistics nerd :splitter: Tue Jul  9 21:29:57 2024
7/10 Got lost but still a good time :splitter: Tue Jul  9 20:48:34 2024

Im running to green building :splitter: Tue Jul  9 16:47:13 2024
Like 8/10. Good first day and my git push actually worked. Good times. I am greatly looking forward to the next ~month. But why did our team not get any coding nerds?!?!?! When I write code only God and I know how it works. The next day only God knows. I am going to have to improve my coding a lot for this to work right. Tragic. ðŸ™‚ :splitter: Mon Jul  8 21:04:52 2024
