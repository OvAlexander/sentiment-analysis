I feel pretty hopeless about the current situation. Although we may have gotten good data, backprojection only shows one big circle. I don't know what's wrong and seems like I'm going to lose sleep tonight :splitter: Tue Jul 30 20:59:55 2024
I'm ok with semantic analysis :splitter: Tue Jul 30 14:16:51 2024
unfortunately, we weren't able to collect useful data, and I feel worried that we may not have a working system on 6/29. I feel frustrated about the limited time in highbay :splitter: Tue Jul 30 14:15:19 2024
we confirmed that automatic syncing is working with very high accuracy :splitter: Fri Jul 26 20:59:41 2024
today we collected some data at highbay, and we've been trying to do backprojection with real data. :splitter: Fri Jul 26 20:59:18 2024
today I implemented my backprojection in C, and tested the range offset. We also created overall procedure for the final event :splitter: Tue Jul 23 21:01:31 2024
Today we got the back projection to work somewhat well. I was able to see that five dots were articulated. Will be working on improving some of the parameters that we are using to produce the back projected image :splitter: Tue Jul 16 21:00:50 2024
Today we got some radar signals back and attempted to create a range time intensity plot. We have been getting errors decoding the radar scan info and been trying to solve it. :splitter: Fri Jul 12 12:18:12 2024
today was a good day! we had some lectures at the start and afterward, we continued working on assembling our F550. We finished assembling at noon, and I started working on making an API script with Ayata. We were able to finish the API script first and moved on to decoding the received message. Every second was precious for us and we even worked during lunch. We are having some issues with GPS, but we hope to resolve it tomorrow. :splitter: Wed Jul 10 21:00:53 2024
The scavenger hunt was quite exhausting... We spent at least 20 minutes trying to find the paper that was put OUTSIDE the BWSI HQ. I'm worried that my team is behind. We just started assembling our drone. We also spent some time getting familiar with git. :splitter: Tue Jul  9 20:59:17 2024
Today, I got to know everyone in the room through the icebreaker. I had some issue pushing the changes in the local repository to the remote repository, it was because I was trying to push the branch within the local repository into the main branch in the remote repository. This made me realize I need to review the github ðŸ˜© However, I am very excited to start out the course. I'm a bit curious as to how the instructors are addressing the problems of wifi routers interfering with the SAR last year. I really hope to learn the application of SAR in wildfire monitoring. :splitter: Tue Jul  8 02:28:53 2024
