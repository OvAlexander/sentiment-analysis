7/30 - i am okay with the discord scraper bot - it seems very cool! today was good progress. steady work that is all :splitter: Tue Jul 30 21:01:13 2024
7/29: THE DRONE FLEW TODAY! backprojection is making progress, syncing data works, demining is underway - excited for the week ahead, it'll be busy but also very rewarding :splitter: Mon Jul 29 21:31:43 2024
7/25: We made good progress today on backprojection! Picking up rhythm again? Drone is still not working even though we've tried a lot of things, but I'm happy with the team today :splitter: Thu Jul 25 20:56:21 2024
7/24: Today was very frustrating. The team has been making very slow progress, and demining as added to the operational queue. I'm very grateful to have some really, really talented teammates, but also feel that we don't have a good synergy to make things work out. I should take more initative, I see my own faults in the last few days and realize I need to up my game :splitter: Wed Jul 24 20:56:24 2024
7/23: More momentum today, lunchtime lecture was really interesting. Feels like we aren't making progress on some big things like drone flying and freq modulation though. Will see how this week goes :splitter: Tue Jul 23 21:01:28 2024
7/22: I was really tired today. Monday did not go well, i had to spend a lot of time tinkering with the new thinkpad i got, should have brought my normal laptop until everything was set up. However, I'm making decent progress on the delta stuff and our tests are going well. Slow and steady wins the race! :splitter: Mon Jul 22 20:54:09 2024
7/18: We got a lot done today, we got our backprojection done, fixed drone motors, got timing synced, and more! It was a big breakthrough after a few days of stalling, feeling good for the next week as we approach halfway through course :splitter: Thu Jul 18 21:17:32 2024
7/16: Today, I didn't contribute as much as I would have liked to the total work, but my group is nonetheless making good progress. I think we're in a good place, and set to figure out backprojection. Things are getting into a flow :splitter: Tue Jul 16 20:55:20 2024
7/15: I felt like we didn't get a lot done today, but it's okay since we have the entire week to do backproj. A lot of work ahead, I feel unusually tired and hope the rest of the week won't be this lethargic :splitter: Mon Jul 15 20:55:14 2024
7/11: We got a LOT done today, feeling very good - we can finish up early tomorrow! We had a few points where it was tricky to continue, but we learned a lot and didn't have nearly as much of a roadblock as yesterday. flying the drone was also fun :splitter: Thu Jul 11 20:49:40 2024
7/10: i felt really really tired by the end of class. i'm sorry for asking you tas so many questions, i felt really stuck today and it was kinda jarring coming from the last 2 days to such a roadblock. i feel like i kinda messed up, kinda halted progress for the group and assumed too much responsibility and didn't let everyone do stuff. i hope to learn from this mistake, we finally got it working in the last 5 minutes of class so everything is alright! i have also been slacking on these journal entries. i also missed my id today. i've been trying to get my act together, to lock in for camp. being here has been amazing, i feel motivated, we've been going to the library every evening, just need to keep up the work :splitter: Wed Jul 10 22:56:24 2024
7/9: today was pretty tiring, starting to get into the routine. the morning lecture was very interesting (i still have a lot of stuff to review on radar ranging and snr), it was fun talking to and meeting my new group :splitter: Wed Jul 10 22:55:08 2024
today was really fun! :splitter: Wed Jul 10 00:31:05 2024
today is day two! i forgot to do yesterday's journal so I will do it now :splitter: Tue Jul  9 20:59:23 2024
yesterday i felt pretty tired by the end, the day felt longer than i expected but also had much more content than i had expected. I was able to help a lot of people with learning git, and was able to meet new people. i am worried about meeting people, and am a little sad about being separated from jeffrey and yuno but also excited to know my new team better :splitter: Tue Jul  8 20:59:23 2024
