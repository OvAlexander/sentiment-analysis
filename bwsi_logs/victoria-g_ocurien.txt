Today was rough too. At least the rti plot is working, but now the mocap is wrong and our drone is still barely flying. I think the backprojection is also not great. I really hope we can get it to work soon enough. *i need to work on mocap data parsing (filtering out flickering). After that, I need to figure out datamerging based on timestamps--create a line of best fit for interpolating timestamps from mocap (the radar data should stay the same)* :splitter: Tue Jul 30 20:52:20 2024
Today was quite difficult. Everything seems to be broken and we are reverting back to our old codes. I want to clean up some of the rtiplot at home and I hope we can get everything working soon :splitter: Mon Jul 29 21:07:05 2024
Today was okay. I feel like we got stuff done and I think we're closer to getting the backprojection working. I'm a bit worried about our drone's functionality issue, but hopefully we can solve that next week. :splitter: Fri Jul 26 21:00:54 2024
Today overall was a bit stressful but I'm happy with the progress we made. We just need to be more organized and careful in our teamwork. Hopefully by tomorrow we will have a semi working backprojection :splitter: Thu Jul 25 20:55:58 2024
Today went alright. I think I made some helpful adjustments to the flightpathtracker but I need to make sure they're more robust. :splitter: Wed Jul 24 20:55:18 2024
Today went well. I finally got the mocap csv to work and even map the flightpath. I'm hoping we can sneak in early tomorrow to get some mocap and radar data for actual data :splitter: Tue Jul 23 21:02:38 2024
Today was frustrating in that the csv editor still doesn't work. I've switched gears and tried to get a parser to read and upload the csv data. :splitter: Mon Jul 22 20:57:40 2024
Today was alright. I am not a fan of csv files or their readers ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ 
I did really enjoy going to draper :splitter: Fri Jul 19 21:10:59 2024
Today was great. We unbombed our code and I was able to alter the heatmap code according to the code review we got, which was helpful. 
I also think Jonny made some really helpful advancements in terms of automating data transfer. I'm struggling a bit with processing the Mocap data, but I think I'm getting closer. :splitter: Thu Jul 18 20:59:47 2024
Today was a bit iffy. I messed up the heatmap code right before pushing it to the github right before lunch : ( but I fixed it now and made it look better (added messages) so it should work fine. I think I just need to be more careful with what I'm pushing and looking it over right before submitting it :splitter: Wed Jul 17 20:57:38 2024
Today I felt like we made a lot of progress. We got a working rti plot and the motors were checked. Tomorrow we beed to clean up the code a bit better, and we need to keep working on the csv :splitter: Tue Jul 16 21:00:30 2024
Today went alright. Our heatmap is closer to working and we now get the data packetys in order. :splitter: Mon Jul 15 20:58:19 2024
I felt like we made decent progress today. It was fun to see how we seem to be falling slightly behind, but I think that'll just motivate us to work harder. Monday, I need to make sure that the correct data collector is uploaded to git because I apparently copied an older version onto my computer and then pushed it onto the git which is not good. :splitter: Fri Jul 12 20:57:41 2024
I coded a heatmapping function, but we have yet to get the data formatted correctly to work with the radar scans. I enjoyed coding it a lot more than I thought I would despite the process being frustrating at times. :splitter: Thu Jul 11 20:56:38 2024
Today was also good, though it was also a bit frustrating.I think we just need to be a bit more careful with both the drone and following instructions. Tomorrow I would like to work on the software aspect. :splitter: Wed Jul 10 21:17:26 2024
Today was good too. The speakers were both interesting and I had fun working on the scavenger hunt. It was also exciting to start working on the drone :splitter: Tue Jul  9 20:52:30 2024
My day went well. Everyone was very nice and collaborated well. Iâ€™m excited for what the future holds ðŸ™‚ :splitter: Mon Jul  8 21:18:11 2024
