i am really bad and back projection and i have spent copious amounts of brain cells on 70 lines of code but at least its kinda almost there :splitter: Wed Jul 17 20:54:38 2024
so frustrated today- plot not working, back projection makes no sense ðŸ˜­ but itâ€™s fine tmrw is a new day so itâ€™s not that bad :splitter: Mon Jul 15 20:59:34 2024
good day today, got good coding progress :splitter: Thu Jul 11 20:59:31 2024
super frustrating day at the beginning, but as i read and researched online resources as well as referring back to the slides, i was able to get some code down with the guidance of instructors. i left feeling more accomplished than frustrated. :splitter: Wed Jul 10 21:57:06 2024
today was fun- loved the guest lecture the scavenger hunt and the drone building :splitter: Tue Jul  9 20:56:24 2024
also the channel name is spelled wrong ðŸ¥² :splitter: Mon Jul  8 21:08:49 2024
my lack of github literacy is def a point of concern, but the courses and lessons up ahead seem super interesting. my teammates are all super confused with github/software stuff too which is a reassurance, since I know we can grow/learn together as time progresses :splitter: Mon Jul  8 21:08:23 2024
